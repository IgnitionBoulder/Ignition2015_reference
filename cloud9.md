### working with files/tabs in the editor

Note these only apply under the "Default" keyboard mode.  To learn more keyboard shortcuts (key bindings)

* `command-E` (mac) / `ctrl-E` (windows): open a file by searching (very fast compared to using the mouse)
* `command-L` (mac) / `ctrl-G` (windows): go directly to line number (useful for debugging exceptions)
* `option-W` (mac) / `alt-W` (windows): close tab  
* `command-[`, `command-]` (mac) / `ctrl-[`, `ctrl-]` (windows):  Go to next tab left (`[`) or right (`]`)
